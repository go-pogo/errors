Package `errors` contains additional functions, interfaces and structs for
recording stack frames, applying basic formatting, working with goroutines,
multiple errors and custom error types.

It is inspired by package `golang.org/x/xerrors` and is designed to be a drop-in
replacement for it, as well as the standard library's `errors` package.

The `errors.New` and `errors.Errorf` functions create errors whose content is a
text message and whom can trace stack frames. `errors.Wrap` and `errors.Wrapf`
create errors by wrapping an existing error with a similar error like
`errors.New` and `errors.Errorf`.

```sh
go get github.com/go-pogo/errors
```

```go
import "github.com/go-pogo/errors"
```

## `Msg`
Instead of defining error messages as global variables, it is possible to define
them as constants using `errors.Msg`.

```go
const ErrSomethingWentWrong errors.Msg = "something went wrong"
```

## Formatting
Wrap an existing error with `errors.WithFormatter` to upgrade the error to
include basic formatting.
Formatting is done using `xerrors.FormatError` and thus the same verbs are
supported. Any error created with this package implements the `fmt.Formatter`
and `xerrors.Formatter` interfaces.

```go
fmt.Printf("%+v", errors.WithFormatter(err))
```

## Stack tracing
Every error can track stack trace information. Just wrap it with
`errors.WithStack` and a complete stack trace is captured.

```go
err = errors.WithStack(err)
```

An `errors.StackTrace` can be retrieved using `errors.GetStackTrace`.
Printing the error results in a trace similar to:

	invalid character 'i' looking for beginning of value:
		github.com/go-pogo/errors.ExampleWithStack
			/path/to/errors/examples_trace_test.go:43
		github.com/go-pogo/errors.ExampleWithStack.func1
			/path/to/errors/examples_trace_test.go:40

## Disable stack tracing
Stack tracing comes with a performance cost. For production environments this
cost can be undesirable. To disable stack tracing, compile your Go program with
the "notrace" tag.

```sh
go build -tags=notrace
```

## Catching panics
A convenient function is available to catch panics and store them as an error.

```go
var err error
defer errors.CatchPanic(&err)
```

## Backwards compatibility
`Unwrap`, `Is` and `As` are backwards compatible with the standard library's 
`errors` package and act the same.
