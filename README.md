Package `errors` contains additional functions, interfaces and structs for recording stack frames,
applying basic formatting, working with goroutines, multiple errors and custom error types.

It is inspired by the `golang.org/x/xerrors` package and is designed to be a drop in replacement for
it, as well as the standard library's `errors`
package.

```sh
go get github.com/go-pogo/errors
```

```go
import "github.com/go-pogo/errors"
```

## Stack trace
Every error can track stack trace information. Just wrap it with `errors.WithStack`
and a complete stack trace is captured.

```go
err = errors.WithStack(err)
```

```text
some error: something happened:
    main.doSomething
       .../errors/examples/2_trace/main.go:17
    main.someAction
       .../errors/examples/2_trace/main.go:12
```

## Formatting
Wrap an existing error with `errors.WithFormatter` to upgrade the error to include basic formatting.
Formatting is done using `xerrors.FormatError` and thus the same verbs are supported.

```go
fmt.Printf("%+v", errors.WithFormatter(err))
```

## Catch panics
A convenient function is available to catch panics and store them as an error.

```go
var err error
defer errors.CatchPanic(&err)
```
