Package `errors` implements functions to manipulate errors, record stack frames and apply basic formatting to errors. It
is inspired by `golang.org/x/xerrors` and is designed to be a drop in replacement for it, as well as the standard
library's `errors` package. The package contains additional functions, interfaces and structs for working with
goroutines, multiple errors and custom error types.

```sh
go get github.com/go-pogo/errors
```

```go
import "github.com/go-pogo/errors"
```

## Stack trace

Every error can track stack trace information. Just wrap it with `errors.Trace()` and an addition stack frame is
captured and stored within the error.

```text
some error: something happened:
    main.doSomething
       .../errors/examples/2_trace/main.go:17
    main.someAction
       .../errors/examples/2_trace/main.go:12
```
